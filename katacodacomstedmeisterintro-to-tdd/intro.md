Test Driven Development
=======================

What is TDD
-----------

Test driven development refers to the act of writing the tests first
and only writing application code when there is a failing test written
first.  It is also referred to as red, green refactor.

* Red create a failing test.  Keep the test as small as possible
* Green write just enough code to make the test pass
* Refactor rework the code without changing the functionality (keep the tests green).
* Repeat

Why would you want to do TDD
----------------------------

* Means that you get to the end of writing code with tests already written
* Forces the consideration of how to test the code before it has been written
* Can highlight unclear requirements earlier in the development process
