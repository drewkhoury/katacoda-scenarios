Summary
=======

This has been a brief introduction to test driven development.  A simple, if slightly
contrived, example has been used to introduce the concept of writing the tests first,
fixing the test and the refactoring whilst keeping the tests passing.

Keep tests small
----------------

By keeping the tests small and incrementally adding functionality, the code is kept in
a working state.  This has the advantage being able to commit to master what has been
completed if what you are working on changes.

Practice
--------

TDD, like many other skills, is something that gets better with practice.  A great way
to extend your skills is to regularly be very strict with yourself and not write any
code unless there is a failing test first.
