Now make the test pass
======================

Let's define the function and make the test pass.

For simplicity's sake, we'll define it within the same file.

The simplest function that can make the test pass is:

<pre class="file" data-target="clipboard">
def my_sum(a, b):
    return a + b
</pre>

Add that function to simpleexample.py and make sure that the tests
now pass.

`python3 ./simpleexample.py`{{execute}}
