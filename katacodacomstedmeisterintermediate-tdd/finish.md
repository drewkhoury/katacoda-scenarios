Recap
=====

We built a web scraper using python.

Writing the tests first forced us to think about how we would test the program
and structure the code to enable easier testing.

We have created code that is composed of small units that can be tested in isolation.

By developing the code in small increments and keeping all of the tests passing at each point,
we could have been continually delivering the code to master knowing that we haven't broken
anything.
